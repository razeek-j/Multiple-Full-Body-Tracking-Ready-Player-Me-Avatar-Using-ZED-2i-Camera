# Key Features
Multiple Full Body Tracking: The project enables the accurate tracking of multiple users' full-body movements in real-time, enhancing multi-user interactions in virtual environments.

Ready Player Me Avatar Integration: Ready Player Me offers an extensive library of customizable avatars. This project seamlessly integrates with Ready Player Me, allowing users to embody their personalized avatars during VR and AR experiences.

ZED 2i Camera: The ZED 2i Camera is a high-quality stereo camera that provides depth perception and motion tracking capabilities. Its integration ensures precise and reliable tracking of users' movements.

# How it Works
ZED 2i Camera Setup: Before using the application, make sure to set up the ZED 2i Camera appropriately. Connect it to your system and ensure it is recognized by the project software.

Calibration: Perform a one-time calibration process to establish the spatial relationship between the ZED 2i Camera and the users' physical positions. This calibration enhances the accuracy of the full-body tracking.

Avatar Customization: Utilize Ready Player Me's avatar customization tools to create your unique virtual representation. Adjust facial features, clothing, accessories, and more to reflect your personality in the virtual world.

Real-time Tracking: Once the ZED 2i Camera is calibrated, it continuously tracks multiple users' full-body movements with low latency. The captured data is used to animate and control the corresponding Ready Player Me avatars in real-time.
